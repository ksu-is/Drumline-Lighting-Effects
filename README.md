# Drumline-Lighting-Effects
This is a program meant for a marching band drumline where LED lights will be attached to the drums and a program will run that will change the colors of the lights along with the peformance.
There will be a user on the front side line that will controll when the lights will change and play through certain sequences.
The lights will be manually controlled because something set on a timer wont always work when a perfromance is never replicated the same twice.

**Currently, as of 4/24, this project stands to simply contruct code and use a Rasberry Pi and Python code to control and manipulate an RGB LED strip of lights.**

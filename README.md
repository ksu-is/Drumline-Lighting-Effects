# Drumline-Lighting-Effects
This is a program meant for a marching band drumline where LED lights will be attached to the drums and depending on where the perform is on the field they will change colors.
The marching band field is spserated out into coordiantes to leanr our drill and how to march. These cordiantes will be used and using a tracker of some sorts to locate the center snare player with the marching field cordinates it will follow a programmed out set of lighting effects that will change for the entier dumline. The "master" controller will be the center snare as he will be the only one being tracked and will cause the light updates.
